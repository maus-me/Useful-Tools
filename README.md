# Useful-Tools
List of useful tools that don't warrant a Bookmark, but used enough times to warrant saving them "somewhere".  

Mostly to avoid having to search for these "obscure" tools (since Google lost the SEO war) when I need them or having to rely on shading download sites.

If there's a useful tool that you think should be included on this list, make a pull request or you can create an issue.
